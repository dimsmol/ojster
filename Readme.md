# Ojster

Ojster is "objective javascript templater" â€” dead simple template engine that translates .ojst templates into javascript classes capable of rendering templates content.

TextMate bundle for Ojster can be found here: https://github.com/4u/Ojster.tmbundle

## Key Concepts

* Templates are JS-based _(similar to EJS)_
* Templates need "compilation" _(similar to Google Closure Templates)_
* Compiled template is a regular JS class

Templates use full power of JS with minimal additions of non-JS syntax. You don't have to learn a lot of new stuff, because you already know the language that is powerful enough to manage your templates. Ojster does not stop you from doing terrible things in templates, just like JS hardly stops you from writing terrible code. You can easily use any dirty tricks, but generally you shouldn't. Be good all the time and be evil only when you really have to.
Ojster provides tags and other non-JS constructions only as a syntax sugar and to hide differences between various frameworks' inheritance and module systems.

With compilation templates are faster and have less errors, because they are already parsed and checked when it's time to render.
Compilation is as simple and straightforward as possible. It's always clear what final code looks like. And you can manage this code as any other code in your project - check it with a linter or any other favorite tool, compress with JS-compressor and so on.
Template is a regular JS class, so you can inherit it from any other class or inherit some class from it or do whatever you usually do with your classes.

## Features

* Templates can be translated into code compatible with:
	* node.js
	* Google Closure Library
	* _other frameworks support can be added easily_
* Same template file _(if properly written)_ can be used to produce code for both node.js and Google Closure Library
* Template blocks can be overridden _(similar to Django templates' blocks, but more rich)_
* Parametrized template blocks are yet not ready, but planned
* Any JS constructions allowed _(for, if, etc.)_
* "Filters" are NOT supported _(use JS code instead)_

Compilation is very fast because it's damn simple. All JS fragments of template are transferred to final code literally. Template blocks are translated into regular methods of compiled JS class. These methods capable of appending corresponding content and nothing more. They can be called any number of times at any place of template, overridden in child templates and so on.

## Syntax

It's recommended to take a look at `examples` directory before continue to read. Examples are very simple and intuitive.
By examining .ojst files and their corresponding .js files (compilation results) you will understand how template code is translated into JS code clearly enough. Further reading provides you with details you could missed.

Template syntax is similar to EJS, but it has some extra conceptions.
All the special constructions are enclosed within `<% %>` tags:

* `<%= ... %>`  - calculate an expression and render result escaped. Translates into something like `this.append(this.escape(...))`
* `<%- ... %>`  - calculate an expression and render result unescaped. Translates into something like `this.append(...)`
* `<% @commandName ... %>`  - one of the commands _(described below)_.
* `<% ... %>` - a raw JS code fragment. Transferees literally. Can contain any JS code including `this.append(...)` calls.

### Commands

* `require` - imports required JS modules
* `template` - describes template itself (it's name and so on)
* `inherits` - describes template's base class
* `init` - defines initializing function
* `func` - defines function
* `block` - breaks a template into reusable parts
* `base` - base method call
* `call` - calls block
* `insert` - inserts other template
* `space` - writes space
* `css` - inserts `getCssName(...)` call

_...other command descriptions to be added..._

#### block command

* `<% @block blockName { %>` - opens block _blockName_
* `<% @block blockName } %>` - closes block _blockName_ (blockName is optional here)

Code related to content between these two commands goes into _appendBlockBlockName_ method of resulting template class.
Blocks can be nested. When block is nested then corresponding method call goes into appropriate place of nesting block.

	<% @block A { %>
		a
		<% @block B { %>
			b
		<% @block } %>
	<% @block } %>

translates into something like

	TemplateClass.prototype.appendBlockA = function() {
		this.append('a');
		this.appendBlockB();
	};

	TemplateClass.prototype.appendBlockB = function() {
		this.append('b');
	};

Note, that nested blocks does not have an access to local variables of nested block, because blocks are translated into completely separated (not nested) functions. The following example doesn't work as you might expect:

	<% @block A { %>
		<% for (var i=0; i<10; i++) { %>
			<% @block B { %>
				<%= i %>
			<% @block } %>
		<% } %>
	<% @block } %>

The examples translate into something like this:

	TemplateClass.prototype.appendBlockA = function() {
		for (var i=0; i<10; i++) {
			this.appendBlockB();
		}
	};

	TemplateClass.prototype.appendBlockB = function() {
		this.append(i);
	};

And of course `i` is undefined within `appendBlockB` function scope. Use parametrized blocks to transfer local variables into scope of a nested block.

`<% @block blockName {} %>` - opens and closes block _blockName_. Such an empty block can be defined to be overridden in child templates.

`main` is a special block name indicating a block that appends to template's `render()` method call.
By default, text outside of any block can be a raw JS code.


## Readme TODO

* move detailed descriptions to `doc/` directory, here should be just quick examples
* for `doc/`:
	* more on syntax
	* all the commands
	* locals
	* detailed usage of `bin/ojster`
	* guide to generated code
* programmatic usage of ojster
* provide short usage of `bin/ojster`
* describe difference between Node and Closure module systems and how it is handled by Ojster
